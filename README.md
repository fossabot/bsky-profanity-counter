Counting your sins (if profanity was a sin).

## How It Works
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fhimynameisdave%2Fbsky-profanity-counter.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fhimynameisdave%2Fbsky-profanity-counter?ref=badge_shield)


1. The bot runs on a schedule (every 10 minutes via GitHub Actions)
2. It checks for new mentions in replies
3. When mentioned, it analyzes the post history of the author of the post being replied to
4. It counts all profanities used by that author
5. It replies with a summary of the profanity count and the most commonly used profanity
